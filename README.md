You are working on the borderline for the free democratic european state. Everyday, a lot ofcivilians crosses the border. 
We are creating software that saves all the information aboutpeople. 
Your task is to create REST API that saves all the information about a person (firstname, last name, date of birth, single/married (with whom), 
living address, phone number,height, nationality, color of eyes, forbidden stuff that was withdrawn, allowed/denied) intoPostgreSQL. 
If the person is already found in the DB update the information with the actualone but you should keep a list of all border crossings for person. 
Also, you should keep a listof all withdrawn personâ€™s stuff (drugs, guns, forbidden literature). 
Create endpoint to showthe latest persons crossed the border.
